Blind people rely mostly on screen readers to consume digital information, relying on sequential auditory feedback, which impairs a quick overview of the content.

We propose taking advantage of the Cocktail Party Effect, which states that people are able to focus their attention on a single voice among several conversations. In fact, research has shown that concurrent speech is able to speed-up the consumption of digital information. In this project, we are investigating novel interactive applications that leverage the use of concurrent speech to improve users' experiences with their devices.
