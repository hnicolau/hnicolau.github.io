Word completion interfaces are ubiquitously available in mobile virtual keyboards; however, there is little research on how to design these interfaces for screen reader users.

In this project, we investigate novel interfaces and interaction techniques for nonvisual word completion. We are particularly interested in quantifying the benefits and costs of such new interfaces.
