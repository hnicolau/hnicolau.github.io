Touchscreen devices are widely used and seem to be the trend for future generations of smartphones. Although touch interfaces are inherently visually demanding, previous research has leveraged touchscreens to provide new input methods for blind users. Particularly, multitouch Braille-based text-entry techniques enable non-visual input using chording actions. However, there is not a non-visual multipoint output method that enables a dialog between the device and the user. Both auditory feedback and single vibrations can inform that a touch occurred; yet, feedback is non-local and usually undirected, failing to provide chording information. Thus, an output channel that actuates directly on users’ fingers, supporting localized multipoint feedback is needed.

This project proposes a system capable of localized vibrotactile feedback that can be combined with the input capabilities of mobile devices.
