Over the last decades there has been much research on mobile accessibility. However, most of it relates to laboratory settings, producing a snapshot of user performance. Understanding how performance changes over time and how people truly use their mobile devices remains an open question. Having a deeper knowledge of the challenges, frustrations, and overall true user experience is of upmost importance to improve current mobile technologies.

In this project, we are creating the tools and gathering the knowledge to characterize user performance in the wild (real-world) in order to improve current devices and interfaces that are used everyday.
