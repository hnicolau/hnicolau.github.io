Since the advent of Apple’s iPhone and its built-in accessibility features, blind people have increased access to mainstream mobile applications. However, the flat surface poses challenges that are only partially solved. Particularly, typing is still slow compared to what sighted people experience.

In this research project we are creating novel non-visual input methods to touch-based form-factors: from tablets to smartwatches.
