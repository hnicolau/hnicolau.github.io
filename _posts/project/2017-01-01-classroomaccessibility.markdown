Following multimedia lectures in mainstream classrooms is challenging for deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students, even when provided with accessibility services. Due to multiple visual sources of information (e.g. teacher, slides, interpreter), these students struggle to divide their attention among several simultaneous sources, which may result in missing important parts of the lecture; as a result, access to information is limited in comparison to their hearing peers, having a negative effect in their academic achievements. 

This project explores two main approaches: 1) providing tools for instructor of DHH students for better delivery of multimedia lectures and 2) use eyewear computers to reduce visual dispersion and increase access to information.
